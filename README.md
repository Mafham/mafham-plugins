# Slayer Tag Highlight
Highlights NPCs on your slayer task that are not interacting with you. This makes it easier to see which NPCs you need to tag for barrage or afk melee slayer in multi areas such as the catacombs.

This plugin requires the default slayer plugin in RuneLite to be enabled to work!
